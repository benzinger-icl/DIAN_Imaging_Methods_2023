Author: Nicole S. McKay 

<b>Important notes:</b>
* Output discussed in the 2023 Nature Neuroscience resource describe <b> participants with imaging data from data release 15</b>. If you have DIAN data from a different data release, please expect plots and descriptive statistics to result in different values 
* We ran our analyses using r (version 4.2.2) and RStudio (version 2022.12.0+353), which can be downloaded here: https://cran.r-project.org/ and here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
