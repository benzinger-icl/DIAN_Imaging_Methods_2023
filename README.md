# DIAN_Imaging_Methods_2023
The code and relevant information needed to reproduce images or descriptive statistics discussed in the 2023 Nature Neuroscience paper: XXX and also outlined in 2023 Research Briefing: XXX
Author: Nicole S. McKay 

<b>Important notes:</b>
* Output discussed in the 2023 Nature Neuroscience resource describe <b> participants with imaging data from data release 15</b>. If you have DIAN data from a different data release, please expect plots and descriptive statistics to result in different values 
* We ran our analyses using r (version 4.2.2) and RStudio (version 2022.12.0+353), which can be downloaded here: https://cran.r-project.org/ and here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
* The listed input files are expected inside the 'Data' folder 
* You can request the required data by filling out the following data request form here: https://dian.wustl.edu/our-research/for-investigators/dian-observational-study-investigator-resources/data-request-form/


<b> Input data:</b>
* Imaging: Cortical thickness summary measure, cortical PiB summary measure, hippocampal volume, total intracranial volume, SUVRs (with partial volume correction) for FDG-Isthmus cingulate, and inferior parietal regions
* Demographics: ID, visit age, years of education, sex, handedness, self reported race, self reported hispanic, primary language 
* Genetics: family ID, apoe allele, ADAD mutation carrying status, ADAD mutation type (PSEN1/PSEN2/APP), ADAD SNP 
* Clinical: estimated age of symptom onset, CDR score
* Cognitive: scores from the following tests: MMSE, WAIS, Animal naming, Boston naming, and delayed logical memory
